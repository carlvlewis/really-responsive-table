# really-responsive-table
In a day in which if `it doesn't work on mobile, it doesn't work,` tables have been a constant thorn in my side. The issue with tables of more than, say, three columns of data is that the data gets so tightly compressed at mobile viewports as to be unreadabble. 

This repository is my workaround for a 100 percent responsive table that can handle whatever dataset you throw its way. At mobile viewports, it changes structure from columnar tables to row-by-row overview summaries.
